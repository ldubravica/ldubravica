- 👋 Hi, I’m @ldubravica

- 👀 Within computer science, my interests cover computer networks, decentralized systems, embedded systems, functional programming, artificial intelligence, and the development of algorithms. Outside of computer science, I am interested in the brain through psychology and neuroscience, in space and physics, and in sustainability through development of green solutions. My goal in life is to noticeably improve the quality of life for people around the world by combining computer science with one of the other mentioned interests.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sustainability oriented projects or psychology/neuroscience oriented projects
