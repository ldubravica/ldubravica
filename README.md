computability, and the development of algorithms. Outside of computer science, I am interested in the brain through
psychology and neuroscience, in space and physics, and in sustainability through development of green solutions. My
goal in life is to noticeably improve the quality of life for people around the world by combining computer science with
one of the other mentioned interests.
