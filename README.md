- 👋 Hi, I’m @ldubravica and I like complex systems

- 👀 Computer science offers us elegant computer networks, decentralized systems, functional programming, and algorithm design. Neuroscience, psychology and psychedelics allow us to peak into the brain and its wicked property - consciousness. And ecology is calling for innovative green solutions to tackle complex issues of sustainability.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on neuroscience and sustainability focused projects. Got any ideas?

- 👨‍💻 I've contributed to the following repositories: [anydex-core](https://github.com/rahimklaber/anydex-core/tree/CSE2000)

- 🌱 I’m currently doing MSc Neuroscience course at King's College London and Imperial College London
